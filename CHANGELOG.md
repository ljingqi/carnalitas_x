## Version 0.3.0

### Interactions

#### General

* Improved all interaction effects to show more relevant information in interface messages.
* Added "age considerations" AI modifier to all slave interactions. The AI is now more willing to buy / acquire and less willing to sell / release slaves if they are between 6 and 50 years of age, and vice versa if they are not. The modifier peaks between 16 and 30 years of age. It is only applied if the slave is considered "useful" to the AI.
* Added additional reasons to the AI to consider slaves as useful when buying / acquiring:
  * Lacking a good court chaplain (based on learning).
  * Lacking a good court physician or antiquarian (based on aptitude; court physician was there also before but it was broken).
  * Could use a good commander (based on martial and commander traits).
* Nerfed the "visibly fertile female" AI modifier to slave interactions.
* Nerfed the attraction AI modifier to slave interactions.
* Buffed the AI unwillingness to sell / release court positions.

#### Gifting Slaves

* Added new *Gift Slave* interaction (`carnx_gift_slave_interaction`). Gift a slave to another ruler for an opinion gain. The opinion gain is proportional to the slave base price and to the "gift opinion / gift value" ratio of the *Send Gift* vanilla interaction. AI rulers are much more likely to accept slaves as gifts than to buy them.

#### Buying ans Selling Slaves

* Changed *Buy Slaves* and *Sell Slaves* to redirect to *Buy Slave* and *Sell Slave* for the actual trade in order to show the AI acceptance reasons and prevent exploits.
* Changed *Sell Slaves* to show only slaves who can actually be sold to somebody.
* Ensured the AI replies immediately to *Buy Slave* and *Sell Slave* offers.
* Enabled the use of hooks in *Buy Slave* and *Sell Slave* interactions.
* Added "price considerations" AI modifier to *Buy Slave* and *Sell Slave* interactions. When buying, the AI is now more willing to buy slaves who are cheap (price < `minor_gold_value`) and less willing to buy slaves who are expensive (price > `major_gold_value`), and vice versa when selling.
* Ensured the AI pays no more than their `short_term_gold` for slaves and changed the corresponding descriptions accordingly.
* Changed the description of the AI base reluctance to spend money modifier from "cannot afford the gold" to "is reluctant to spend gold".

#### Ransoming Slaves

* Buffed dread impact on *Ransom Slave* AI willingness for vassals and below. They will now practically always accept if intimidated or cowed.
* Buffed the AI base willingness to offer *Ransom Slave* to other rulers.
* Added "ransomed" memory as a different memory from "freed".

#### Slave Prices

* Reduced the correction multiplier of the slave base price from 0.75 to 0.6, making slaves cheaper across the board.
* Adjusted slave prices down for tribal rulers (as everything is cheaper for them).
* Changed some factors affecting the slave base price:
  * Nerfed claims to 100 for any type of claim (before it scaled from 100 to 250).
  * Rebalanced court physician traits to match aptitude, added an antiquarian trait.
  * Nerfed prowess from 5 to 3 per point.
  * Buffed attraction (from 20 to 30 for max attraction).
  * Nerfed "visibly fertile female" from 20 to 15.
  * Added age (up to 12, similar to the AI modifier described above).

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed *Buy Slaves* and *Sell Slaves* allowing to select a slave after a buyer or a seller has been selected.
* Fixed *Ransom Slave* not selecting a default option and allowing to be sent without an option selected.
* Fixed concubines not being "divorced" when enslaved (Carnalitas bug).

### Miscellaneous

* If a character loses their last title, their slaves are no longer freed, instead they are seized by the new title holder.
* Enabled imprisoning slaves w/o tyranny (vanilla change).

* Extracted positive and negative "impact values" as script values in `carnx_basic_values.txt`.
